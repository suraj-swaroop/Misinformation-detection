# Misinformation-detection

This repository mainly includes information and resources for automatic misinformation detection, which is an important topic in Natural Language Processing. By definition, misinformation refers to the distribution of false information (opposite to facts) in the context of news. It can futher be sub classified as disinformation, rumors, trolls, spams or urban legends. This project will focus on gathering fact based data and designing models using Python, NLP, DL and ML to identify if a news article is either reliable or not.
